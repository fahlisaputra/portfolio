Hi, I’m Muhammad Fahli Saputra — a system analyst and software engineer who’s passionate about designing technology that
actually solves problems. Based in Banjarbaru, Indonesia, I’ve spent nearly a decade turning complex business needs into
secure, scalable, and reliable software systems.

I started my journey with code, but along the way I realized my strength lies in connecting business vision with
technical execution. From mapping out requirements, designing system architecture, to delivering production-ready
solutions, I enjoy making technology work not just today, but for the long run.

Over the years, I’ve built web and mobile applications, architected multi-tenant platforms, and led projects that helped
businesses reduce operational time, improve decision-making, and scale with confidence. My expertise spans Laravel, PHP,
Kotlin, JavaScript, SQL/NoSQL databases, and cloud infrastructure. I’m also deeply familiar with Linux system
administration, containerization with Docker, and deployment pipelines that keep systems secure and reliable.

Outside of engineering, I’ve contributed to open source, created educational content about system administration, and
explored machine learning to bring intelligence into business workflows. I also run my own software company, where I
combine my entrepreneurial mindset with technical skills to build solutions that empower people and organizations.

I graduated as the Most Outstanding Informatics Engineering Graduate from Universitas Negeri Malang, a recognition that
reflects not just academic achievement but also my dedication to the field.

When I’m not in front of a screen, you’ll probably find me enjoying coffee in nature, playing games, or recharging with
music and movies. I believe good systems—and good lives—need balance.
