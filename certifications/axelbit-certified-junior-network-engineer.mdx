### Key Competencies

- **Subnetting & IP Addressing** — VLSM, CIDR, network/host calculation, and multi-segment IP
  planning.
- **Switching Fundamentals** — VLANs, trunk/access configuration, basic inter-VLAN routing, and STP
  concepts.
- **Routing** — Static routing and introduction to dynamic routing protocols (RIP/OSPF).
- **Wireless Networking** — Channel planning, coverage optimization, security (WPA2/WPA3), and
  interference management.
- **Network Security** — Basic ACLs, NAT, port security, and network segmentation best practices.
- **Troubleshooting** — Layer-by-layer analysis (OSI model), ping/traceroute diagnostics, and DHCP
  or loop issues.

### Practical Implementation

- Configured routers and switches using CLI-style workflows and small-scale topology simulations.
- Validated VLAN segmentation and failover using ping/ARP and static route testing.
- Documented configuration changes and created baseline network templates.
- Deployed network segmentation for performance and security, including NAT and ACL filtering.

### Real-World Applications

- Designed IP schemes for multi-segment environments (user, management, IoT/camera).
- Implemented VLAN-based segmentation for better security and traffic isolation.
- Laid the groundwork for scalable dynamic routing as network complexity increased.

### Achievements

- Successfully completed an end-to-end configuration scenario (design → implementation →
  verification).
- Officially certified by **Axelbit** for core networking competencies. View credential:
