longDescription: "SkendaOS is an experimental operating system built on top of the CosmosOS kernel using C# and .NET. Designed for learning purposes, it provides a command-line interface (CLI) environment with core features such as file system management (FAT12, FAT16, FAT32), user authentication, DHCP/DNS configuration, and basic networking. The system showcases how high-level languages like C# can be used to develop low-level OS functionalities."

## Summary

**SkendaOS** is an **experimental operating system** developed using **C#** and **.NET**, built on top of the **CosmosOS kernel** — a framework that allows developers to create custom operating systems using managed code.
The system features a **command-line interface (CLI)** with built-in utilities for managing users, files, and basic network settings.

SkendaOS currently runs on **VMware**, supporting **FAT12**, **FAT16**, and **FAT32** file systems.
It includes modules for **multi-user authentication**, **DHCP/DNS configuration**, and **network utilities** like PING and DNS lookup.

## Problem

Many developers never get the chance to explore how operating systems work internally due to the steep learning curve of low-level programming languages like C or Assembly.
The goal of SkendaOS was to **bridge that gap** — by demonstrating how a high-level language such as C# (through CosmosOS) could still be used to design and understand kernel operations, file systems, and user management.

## Goal / Use Case

- Build an **educational and experimental OS** using CosmosOS as the base kernel.
- Provide a functional **CLI interface** with command parsing and user authentication.
- Implement file system operations supporting **FAT12**, **FAT16**, and **FAT32**.
- Develop **network modules** for DHCP client configuration and DNS resolution.
- Support **multi-user login**, **language settings**, and **custom nameserver** options.
- Serve as a learning platform for exploring how .NET code interacts with low-level system components.

## Impact

- Demonstrated the capability of **C# and .NET** to operate at the system level using CosmosOS.
- Helped deepen understanding of **kernel-layer communication**, file systems, and network stack design.
- Provided a sandbox for experimenting with OS-level logic such as authentication, configuration management, and network connectivity.
- Inspired exploration into using managed code for embedded and experimental operating system projects.

## Development Duration

Developed incrementally over several months as a personal research project.
The latest version, **SkendaOS 1.6**, introduced major updates and improvements:

- **[ADDED]** 6 new CLI commands: `adduser`, `dhcp`, `dns`, `language`, `passwd`, `rmuser`
- **[FIXED]** Improved DHCP client reliability
- **[ADDED]** DHCP renew and release functionality
- **[ADDED]** Multi-user login system
- **[ADDED]** Indonesian language support
- **[ADDED]** Custom nameserver configuration
- **[FIXED]** Stability improvements for PING and DNS lookup

SkendaOS is designed to run on **VMware** using a **FAT32-formatted virtual disk image**, provided as a ready-to-use template.
