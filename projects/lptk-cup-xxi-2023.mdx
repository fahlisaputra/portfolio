This project served as the official website for the **LPTK Cup XXI 2023**, a multi-sport national event hosted by Universitas Negeri Malang.
The platform provided comprehensive information about the competition, including schedules, participant registration, and real-time match updates across several sports such as badminton, table tennis, lawn tennis, and petanque.
Each sport had its own sub-website, allowing organizers to manage participants, teams, and match fixtures independently, all integrated under one centralized system.

## Problem
Before this project, participant data and match schedules were managed separately for each sport, leading to difficulties in coordination and inconsistent participant verification.

## Goal / Use Case
To build a unified event management system that allows organizers to register participants, verify their data, form teams, assign matches, and publish schedules seamlessly.
The system also integrated with **PDDIKTI** to verify participants’ lecturer status, ensuring data accuracy for all registered athletes.

## Impact
The platform simplified the event management process and provided a single digital hub for organizers, referees, and participants.
It enabled real-time schedule updates, automated verification, and public access to match details — including live streaming links — improving transparency and engagement throughout the tournament.

## Development Duration
The project was developed within approximately one and a half months, from system design to deployment ahead of the event launch.
