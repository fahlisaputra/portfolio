**Colormatch** is an interactive web application designed to help users explore and visualize color harmony concepts such as **analogous**, **monochromatic**, and **complementary** color schemes.
Users can generate color palettes from a digital color wheel and immediately apply them to a canvas for creative experimentation.

One of the app’s unique features allows users to upload plain images or uncolored line art — for example, batik pattern outlines — and color them directly within the browser by simply clicking on each area.
The project was originally designed to support **batik artisans and small fashion businesses (UMKM)** in experimenting with color combinations before producing physical samples, saving time and materials during the design process.

## Problem
Many small-scale fashion and batik entrepreneurs struggle with visualizing harmonious color combinations before production, often relying on manual sketches or trial-and-error methods.

## Goal / Use Case
To create an intuitive digital tool that simplifies the exploration of color theory concepts and allows users to apply color palettes directly to visual templates or batik patterns.

## Impact
Colormatch provided an accessible way for batik designers and fashion creators to conceptualize color harmony digitally.
It helped artisans reduce design experimentation costs and brought a more modern, technology-driven workflow into traditional creative industries.

## Development Duration
The project was designed and developed over approximately three weeks, from prototype to production-ready version.
