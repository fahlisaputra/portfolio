**Minify for Laravel** is an open-source package that automatically minifies Blade-rendered views, CSS, and JavaScript files to boost application performance with minimal setup.
It includes a built-in JavaScript obfuscator that works on-the-fly and a smart native caching system that detects file changes through timestamps, ensuring optimized delivery without manual configuration.

In practical testing, the package reduces asset sizes by **10–40%**, significantly improving page load times and reducing bandwidth usage.
Since its release, it has been **installed over 116,000 times on Packagist**, gained **100+ GitHub stars**, and **21 forks**, reflecting its growing adoption and trust within the Laravel developer community.

## Problem
Laravel developers often depend on manual build tools or external scripts to minify assets, which adds complexity to deployment pipelines and slows down iteration speed.

## Goal / Use Case
To provide a plug-and-play optimization solution that automatically handles asset minification, obfuscation, and caching directly inside Laravel — no extra tools, no build steps.

## Impact
The package simplifies performance optimization for Laravel developers, enhances page speed, and reduces server load.
Its popularity demonstrates strong community adoption, helping thousands of developers achieve faster, cleaner, and more secure production builds.

## Development Duration
The initial version was developed in just two weeks and has been actively maintained and improved through community feedback and contributions.
