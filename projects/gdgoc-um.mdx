This project is the official website of the **Google Developer Group on Campus (GDGoC)** at Universitas Negeri Malang, built collaboratively by an eight-member team of contributors.
The website serves as a digital hub for the organization — showcasing community activities, members, teams, blog posts, and announcements — while also offering an interactive experience for visitors.

One of the main features I developed was the **quiz module**, inspired by platforms like **Kahoot** and **Quizzizz**.
It allows users to participate in developer-themed quizzes through a clean and responsive interface.
While the animations were intentionally kept minimal for performance reasons, the focus was on creating a seamless and engaging user experience powered by real-time Firebase integration.

## Problem
The GDGoC chapter needed a unified platform to present its activities, recruit members, and engage the developer community.
Before this project, communication and content distribution were scattered across multiple channels, making it hard to maintain a professional and consistent presence.

## Goal / Use Case
To build an open-source website that reflects the spirit of GDGoC — modern, educational, and community-driven.
The goal was to centralize information, improve visibility, and create interactive experiences that encourage student participation and learning.

## Impact
The website helped increase member engagement and provided an official presence for the GDGoC UM chapter.
The quiz feature became one of the most-used modules during workshops and events, allowing participants to learn interactively while tracking their performance in real time.
Overall, the project strengthened the chapter’s online identity and served as a collaborative learning experience for all contributors.

## Development Duration
The project was completed over approximately one month, from initial design and content setup to development and deployment.
