This project is a comprehensive **sales and inventory management system** developed for CV Saldam to address the challenges of inaccurate reporting and stock discrepancies caused by field-level inconsistencies.
The platform helps business owners oversee daily operations, monitor sales performance, and track product flow across multiple branches with precision.

Through its web dashboard, administrators can manage products, purchase and selling prices, calculate profits, and track stock movements â€” including stock-in, stock-out, transfers, and stock opname.
It also features sales performance analytics and financial summaries that provide clear insights into revenue, profit margins, and cash flow.

The system integrates seamlessly with a dedicated Android application used by field sales staff.
Every transaction performed in the field is automatically synchronized with the central system, including **GPS coordinates** and **store photos** for each sale, giving management full visibility into where and how transactions occur.
Offline mode is also supported, allowing sales data to be stored locally and synced automatically once the device reconnects to the internet.

## Problem
The company struggled with unreliable manual reporting and frequent mismatches between recorded sales and actual stock levels.
Some field employees were also suspected of manipulating data, causing financial discrepancies and loss of inventory visibility.

## Goal / Use Case
To develop an integrated sales and inventory management system that connects office administrators and field sales teams in real time.
The goal was to improve transparency, prevent fraud, and ensure accurate tracking of both products and sales activities.

## Impact
The system successfully reduced stock discrepancies and improved overall operational efficiency.
Business owners gained real-time insights into sales transactions, inventory movements, and employee activities, allowing faster and more informed decision-making.
It also established accountability within the sales team through GPS-based tracking and photo verification.

## Development Duration
The project was developed over approximately three months, covering system design, integration with the Android client app, and deployment for day-to-day business use.
