## Summary

This Android app was developed as part of an **Internet of Things (IoT)** course project to accompany a custom-built **Smart Door Lock system** using **ESP8266** and an **RFID reader**.
The app serves as a configuration and management interface for the hardware, allowing users to perform Wi-Fi setup, pairing, and RFID card registration directly from the mobile device.

A **WebSocket server built with Node.js** facilitates real-time communication between the app and the ESP8266 module, while **Firebase** handles user authentication and device registration.


## Problem

Traditional door locks lack remote configurability and secure digital access management.
During development, a key challenge was creating a seamless way to **pair and configure IoT hardware** without physical access or manual configuration through serial tools.
The goal was to allow any user to set up and manage the smart door lock system intuitively using only their Android phone.

## Goal / Use Case

- Provide a **pairing and setup interface** for ESP8266-based smart door locks.
- Automatically detect nearby devices through Wi-Fi scanning and “ping” tests to identify the target hardware.
- Allow users to input network credentials and send them to the device for configuration.
- Maintain a **WebSocket channel** to monitor setup progress and device readiness.
- Support **RFID card registration** and management directly from the mobile app.
- Ensure secure synchronization of device data and unique identifiers with Firebase.

## Impact

- Simplified the provisioning process for IoT smart locks — no need for manual setup or serial connections.
- Enabled real-time communication between mobile, server, and IoT device through WebSocket and Firebase.
- Allowed **RFID registration** and lock control directly from the Android app, improving usability and security.
- Served as a complete demonstration of the IoT ecosystem (mobile, server, and embedded device integration).
- Helped showcase practical IoT implementation for academic presentation and competition readiness.

## Development Duration

Developed over approximately **1 month** as part of the **Internet of Things** course project.
Built using **Java**, **Firebase**, and **Node.js WebSocket** for the server communication layer.
The hardware side utilized **ESP8266** with **RFID reader**, forming a fully connected smart door lock prototype.
