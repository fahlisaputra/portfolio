**Phenomine** is a full-stack PHP framework that I built from scratch as a personal exploration into modern web architecture and framework design.
What started as a simple boilerplate project evolved into a complete framework with **built-in routing**, multi-database ORM, and a flexible templating engine powered by **Latte**.

The framework also integrates **Tailwind CSS** and **HTMX** natively, enabling developers to build interactive applications that feel like Single Page Apps — all without writing JavaScript.
This setup provides a seamless developer experience for backend developers who want SPA-like interactivity using pure PHP and HTML.

## Problem
Existing PHP frameworks often require additional tools or JavaScript front-ends to achieve modern reactive behavior.
This complexity increases the barrier for backend-focused developers who prefer simplicity and server-driven UI.

## Goal / Use Case
To create a lightweight, modern PHP framework that unifies essential web development features — routing, ORM, templating, and reactive UI — into one cohesive ecosystem.
Phenomine aims to empower developers to build rich, modern web applications quickly without sacrificing simplicity.

## Impact
Phenomine proves that PHP can still deliver modern, reactive web experiences without relying on complex client-side frameworks.
It has inspired many developers to explore backend-first approaches again, blending performance, simplicity, and maintainability within a single stack.

## Development Duration
The framework was developed over several months through iterative experimentation, continuous learning, and community feedback.
