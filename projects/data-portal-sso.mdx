This project is a comprehensive data management platform for the Faculty of Vocational Studies at Universitas Negeri Malang. It centralizes and synchronizes data for students, lecturers, study programs, and competence groups (KBK). Administrators can also register new SSO client applications within the system, enabling seamless data exchange between internal and external applications. An integrated dashboard provides visual insights into academic statistics such as student demographics, lecturer distribution, and study program performance. The system is also connected with **PDDIKTI**, ensuring data consistency with the national higher education database.

## Problem
The faculty operated multiple separate applications for academic and administrative needs, resulting in fragmented and inconsistent data across systems. This lack of integration caused difficulties in maintaining up-to-date records and led to discrepancies between applications.

## Goal / Use Case
To develop a centralized academic data portal equipped with SSO capabilities, enabling every faculty system to connect through a unified authentication and data layer. The goal was to standardize academic data, reduce redundancy, and improve accuracy and accessibility for administrators and related applications.

## Impact
The new portal significantly streamlined data management within the faculty, reducing manual data reconciliation efforts and ensuring consistency across systems. It improved operational efficiency and provided real-time visibility into key academic indicators, helping faculty leadership make more informed decisions. Additionally, the SSO integration simplified user access, allowing lecturers and staff to log in to multiple systems with a single account.

## Development Duration
The entire system was developed over approximately two and a half months, from initial architecture design and database modeling to the deployment of the SSO integration and dashboard analytics modules.
