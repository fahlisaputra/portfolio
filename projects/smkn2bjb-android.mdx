## Summary

This Android application was built for **SMK Negeri 2 Banjarbaru** to make academic information easily accessible for students and teachers.
Teachers can view their **teaching schedules**, while students can see their **class timetables**.
When the current school day ends, the app automatically shows the **next upcoming schedule**, ensuring students never forget their classes.

The app also includes a **student leaderboard** to encourage academic performance, an **anonymous reporting feature** for submitting feedback or complaints directly to the principal, and an **event/agenda section** that lists upcoming school activities.

## Problem

Before this app, schedules and announcements were distributed manually or through group chats, which often led to:
- Students forgetting upcoming classes or updated timetables.
- Teachers lacking a centralized view of their own teaching schedule.
- Difficulty for students to express complaints or report issues privately.
- Limited visibility of school events and academic achievements.

## Goal / Use Case

- Provide a centralized mobile platform for students and teachers to access schedules and announcements.
- Automatically display **upcoming class schedules** after school hours.
- Display a **leaderboard** for top-performing students.
- Enable an **anonymous reporting system** for students to submit concerns directly to the school administration.
- List **school events and activities** in a simple agenda view.

## Impact

- Improved communication and transparency between teachers, students, and administration.
- Reduced forgotten or missed classes thanks to real-time schedule reminders.
- Encouraged healthy academic competition through the leaderboard feature.
- Provided a safe channel for students to voice concerns anonymously.
- Simplified dissemination of information about upcoming school events.

## Development Duration
