## Summary

Sales Management Android App is the **mobile companion** of the Sales Management System built for **CV Saldam**.
This app enables both **business owners and field sales representatives** to manage daily sales operations efficiently â€” whether online or offline.

Owners can monitor transactions and stock activities in real-time, while sales staff can record transactions directly from the field.
The app synchronizes data automatically when the device reconnects to the internet and uses **GPS tracking** and **store photo validation** to prevent fraudulent activity.

## Problem

Previously, sales operations relied heavily on manual reporting and periodic synchronization with desktop systems.
This caused:
- Delays in data consolidation and transaction visibility for management.
- Risk of **fraud** (fake transactions or visits) due to lack of location verification.
- Inconsistent inventory updates between central warehouse and field stock.
- Difficulty managing **offline transactions** in remote areas with unstable connectivity.

## Goal / Use Case

- Allow sales representatives to **create and manage transactions offline**, syncing automatically once connected.
- Enable business owners to **monitor live sales performance and inventory movement** from anywhere.
- Record **GPS coordinates** and **store photos** for each transaction as anti-fraud measures.
- Provide seamless **thermal printer integration** via Bluetooth for instant receipt printing.
- Offer lightweight and intuitive UI to ensure usability even on low-end Android devices.

## Impact

- Significantly improved **transparency and accountability** of sales operations.
- Reduced potential fraud cases by validating field visits through GPS and photo evidence.
- Increased operational efficiency through real-time stock and transaction synchronization.
- Supported both **online and offline workflows**, ensuring uninterrupted productivity for sales teams.
- Enhanced management insights with instant data updates across all branches.

## Development Duration

Developed over **2 months**, from prototype to deployment.
The project was built using **Java** with **Firebase Realtime Database** and **local SQLite caching**, supporting both online/offline modes.
It also integrated **Google Maps Platform** for GPS tracking and store visualization, along with **Bluetooth thermal printer support** for instant receipt printing.
