**Fahli.dev** is my personal portfolio website — a digital space where I showcase my professional journey, open-source projects, and product design philosophy.
Originally built as a static HTML site using Bootstrap back in 2020, it later evolved into a Laravel Livewire-based version in 2023.
In 2025, I completely rebuilt it from the ground up with a modern front-end stack to reflect my growth as an engineer and my attention to detail in both design and performance.

The site is powered by **Next.js 15** and **React 19**, with **Tailwind CSS** and **Shadcn UI** providing a clean, cohesive design system.
All content is written in **MDX**, making it easy to mix markdown with interactive components and animations.
I also integrated **Sentry** for error monitoring and performance analytics, ensuring the website remains reliable and optimized under production load.
Each project, blog post, and showcase is rendered dynamically, leveraging the static generation and hybrid rendering capabilities of Next.js for maximum speed and SEO performance.

## Problem
My older portfolio was built with outdated tools and lacked scalability.
It was difficult to maintain, had no dynamic content structure, and didn’t represent the level of modern engineering and design practices I apply in my work today.

## Goal / Use Case
To create a personal portfolio that not only displays my work but also reflects my engineering mindset — clean architecture, performance awareness, and visual polish.
The new version was built to be modular, content-driven, and future-proof, making it easy to extend as my professional journey evolves.

## Impact
The new **Fahli.dev** has become more than a portfolio — it’s a living documentation of my craft as a software engineer.
It improved SEO visibility, reduced build times, and introduced a fully interactive experience across devices.
More importantly, it became a platform where I can continuously share projects, achievements, and insights that shape my career.

## Development Duration
The rebuild took approximately three weeks, including design iteration, component development, content migration, and deployment.
