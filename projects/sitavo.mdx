**Sitavo** is a web-based platform developed for the Faculty of Vocational Studies at Universitas Negeri Malang to digitalize and streamline the **final project management process** for students, lecturers, and program administrators.
It simplifies every stage — from proposal submission and supervisor assignment to guidance monitoring, examination scheduling, and grading.

Students can submit their project titles and choose supervisors directly through the system, while lecturers can manage supervision records and monitor student progress online.
Each study program (Prodi) has its own administrative dashboard to assign examiners, record grades, and conduct eligibility assessments, ensuring every academic step is well-documented and easily accessible.

## Problem
The faculty previously handled final project submissions and supervision manually through paper forms and scattered communication channels.
This often caused delays, data duplication, and difficulties in tracking each student’s progress.

## Goal / Use Case
To build a centralized, transparent platform that connects students, supervisors, and program administrators in one integrated system.
The goal was to reduce administrative overhead, improve visibility of supervision activities, and ensure accountability across the entire final project process.

## Impact
Sitavo significantly improved efficiency and coordination within the faculty.
Students could track their progress and deadlines in real time, while lecturers and administrators gained a clearer overview of supervision workloads and examination schedules.
The system also reduced paperwork and human error, contributing to a smoother and more transparent academic process.

## Development Duration
The project was developed over approximately five months, from initial requirement gathering to full deployment for faculty-wide use.
